Plugin for Roundcube Webmail

This plugin is the result of our commitment to helping in the global struggle against SPAM.

The plugin offers a new button in the Roundcube Webmailer which will POST anonymized Header-Information of SPAM-Mails to services such as Blackhole.MX [0].

You can also use it as a means of reporting SPAM to your local scripts since the configuration allows for multiple services to be enabled. Please see the README file for further information.
